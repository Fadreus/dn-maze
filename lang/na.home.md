MAZE is a DragonNest Skill Calculator. Nothing more to be said about it.

**Features:**

- Build URL + History

  For all actions applied to skills, your URL bar will be updated. Please use your own URL bar as the link to share with others!

- Search

  Search through the current description of all skills using [Regular Expressions](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp).

- Level Selection

  Select from a list of available levels depending on what cap you want to simulate for. Going down level caps will reset all progress of skills, while going up does not.

- Free/Strict Mode

  By default users are set to Free mode. In Free mode, you can level up any skill any way you want with the only restriction that you cannot exceed the available SP.

  If changed to strict mode, the skill tree will behave like in game - you can only level up a skill if you have fulfilled its requirements.

  Changing between modes will persist throughout every build. Every shared Build URL defaults to free mode, though.

- PvE/PvP Mode

  By default users are set to PvE mode. If changed to PvP mode, the relevant fields will auto update to PvP mode (and similarly for PvE mode).

  PvE/PvP mode is not locked into the Build URL, but by the user session. It is a user preference, not part of the build itself.
